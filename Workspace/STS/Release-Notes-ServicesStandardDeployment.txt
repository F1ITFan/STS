Release: SSD v6 GA
Released: 27 July 2018 

****************************************
OVERVIEW OF RELEASE
****************************************

Version 6 of the consolidated Services Standard Deployment (SSD) contains a number of new
components, enhancements and fixes.


****************************************
NEW TO THIS RELEASE:
****************************************

SSB: 
    - The OWASP Dependency Check tool, which can report on known vulnerabilities in third-
      party libraries, is now included in the SSB.  This self-updating tool can check the 
      libraries that ship with IdentityIQ as well as those which are added to the build by
      implementers.
    - Ability to manage the deployment of site-specific encryption keys as part of the
      build process.
    - Support for 'includefiles' functionality which allows specifying the XML files that
      should be included in a 'subset build'.  This is useful for times when it is not
      necessary to deploy a full build but just update specific XML objects.
    - Enhancements to SSB Build Checks:
         Detect deprecations in non-public APIs
         Handle nested imports in BeanShell when detecting deprecations
         Check for workflows which have trace enabled
         Reduced console logging for improved presentation
    - Expansion of efixes in the order they were created to avoid conflicts when two
      different versions of the same file are included in separate efixes.
    - 'Secret' target.properties for keeping sensitive token values separate from the main
      target.properties file so they can be stored outside of the code repository.

Please refer to the SSB User Guide for more information on the above features.

SSF Tools:
    - LogiPlex connector - a new connector that combines some of the functionality of the
      Logical connector and the Multiplex application type.  Useful for managing 
      applications that are based on subsets of another applications, such as an 
      application whose access is defined by Active Directory groups.  This connector 
      performs well with large numbers of applications and entitlements and may be 
      considered an alternative to the Logical connector for certain use cases.  Please 
      refer to the LogiPlex Connector User Guide for details.
    - IdentityIQ Summarizer tool - produces a summary of the configuration of a number of 
      object types that are typically part of an IdentityIQ deployment. The summary is in
      the form of an Excel spreadsheet.  Please refer to the IdenitityIQ Summarizer User
      Guide.
    - Mock Integration Executor - simulates creation of tickets in a ticketing system by 
      writing to and querying a Custom object that maintains a map of ticket numbers and 
      statuses.  Useful for developers who need to build a solution for ticketing 
      integration but don't have a sandbox instance of the ticketing system.  Please refer
      to the Mock Integration Executor User Guide for further information.
    - Object Exporter enhancement - ability to remove statistical metadata from 
      TaskDefinitions and Applications.
    - Loopback connector enhancements - allows the use of password resets and password 
      management when internal IdentityIQ authentication is being used.
    - Email Template Editor enhancement - allows use of color controls when creating and
      editing HTML email templates.

SST Tools:
    - JUnit Helper enhancements:
         Can now manage IdentityIQ sessions on a per-test basis or per-Class.  This means
         that IdentityIQ instances will only be spun up as required to improve performance.
         Added a Factory class to allow developers to access the context themselves, with 
         the added responsibility of shutting the instance down once they have done their
         work.
 
Bugs fixed since SSD v5 GA

 - Enhanced Email Notifier Task Executor was using the STMP email notifier class directly
   when redirects were in use (SSDBUGS-186)

   IdentityIQ 7.3 (SSDBUGS-185)

   were being processed (SSDBUGS-144)

   preventing trigger firing (SSDBUGS-163)

   issues (SSDBUGS-184)

   (SSDBUGS-153)

   some cases (SSDBUGS-135)

   (SSDBUGS-109)
 - Potential XML Entity Expansion vulnerability in the Generic Importer fixed 
   (SSDBUGS-177)
 - Potential XML Entity Expansion vulnerability in the SSB Build Checks fixed 
   (SSDBUGS-178)
 - SSF Leaver was sometimes failing when calling sunset workflow (SSDBUGS-167)
 - Approval Framework was not removing entitlements for a remove request when 
   cstPreApprovalDefaultSplitterRule method was being used (SSDBUGS-159)

   fail (SSDBUGS-165)
 - SSF Mover certification launch was failing for partitioned identity refresh 
   (SSDBUGS-176)
 - SSF Mover and Approval were using an incorrect Java method for getting boolean values
   (SSDBUGS-171)
 - Access Request Attachments deployment was sometimes writing configuration to web.xml 
   when it already existed (SSDBUGS-169)
 - SSF ProvisionProcessor threw a NPE when there was a PolicyViolation (SSDBUGS-175)
 - SSF Approval Framework: role removal work items were missing required entries, causing
   NPE (SSDBUGS-170)
 - Typo corrected in logger for SSF Approval Framework Rule Library (SSDBUGS-157)
 - SSF Approval Framework checkItemRequiresApproval method was returning incorrect result
   (SSDBUGS-156)

   building against IdentityIQ 7.3 (SSDBUGS-179)
 - Enhanced Email Notifier was not honoring the email redirection settings (SSDBUGS-145)

****************************************
NOTES
****************************************

JDK version 6 is no longer supported in the SSB/SSD.  Please use JDK 7 or 8.

To assist the SailPoint Support team, the version of the SSB or SSD used to build 
IdentityIQ can now be seen by accessing the ServicesStandardVersion.html file at the root
of the application (e.g. http://servername:8080/ServicesStandardVersion.html).  This
information is taken from these release notes, so please do not delete this file or move
it from its current location, and do not delete the html file that is generated during the
build process.  The page also includes a timestamp indicating the last time the build was
executed.

SSF provisioning now runs in the background by default for all the SSF features, which
means provisioning will not happen until the next time the Perform Maintenance task runs.
This is the recommended setting to avoid identity locking conflicts during identity 
refreshes.

If you are currently using a version of the SSF features and frameworks from SSD v1.1 or
earlier there is no simple upgrade procedure for these components.  An upgrade would be a
more in-depth exercise carried out by a trained and experienced IdentityIQ implementer.
